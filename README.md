# Welcome to my github!
## Who Am I
I'm a problem solver who loves learning new tools and skills, whether it's in tech or another domain. You can check out [my website](https://ddsmit.com) for a quick summary of who I am, my career history, and a smattering of other things.
## What Drive Me
My family and learning new things. 
## What's Next
I've been digging a lot into various smaller scale friendly tools like DuckDB, and I'm starting to dig into LLM's and langchain more. I'm hoping I can leverage these tools in new and interesting ways.
