<h1>What Is A Data</h1>
<h2>So Much Datas, So Much Confusion</h2>
<p>
    There are many, many, many roles with "Data" in the title. There are Data Wranglers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers,
    etc. What do all of the different titles mean and what does their day to day work look like? Unfortunately, the answer is 
    (as many answers are), "it depends".

<h2>What is Data and Why Should We Care</h2>
<p>
    Throughout history, we have been collecting and acting on data. Whether it's a restaurante counting various orders to understand
    how they want to prep for the next day, or a company like Facebook analyzing extrememly grainular data points like dwell time, 
    mouse positions, clicks, etc (and processing them in a massive and highly advanced model), people have been using data to try
    and make better decisions.
