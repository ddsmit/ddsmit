<h1>The Open Source Landfill for My Mind</h1>
<p>
I have a goal to try and document and write more, and I'm trying to bring down the hyper-critical filter I have to keeps 
me from putting out more of my thoughts. To achieve this, I'm going to create a structure that seperates the quick notes
from the more detailed information. The structure I think makes sense (at least for now because you have always be improving)
 is to have more long-form, evergreen articles in the <a href="/Thoughts/Articles">Articles</a> section, quick, daily/weekly notes 
 and entries in the <a href="/Thoughts/Journal">Journal</a> section,
 and other mind dumps like packages I want to check out, things I like, etc in a <a href="/Thoughts/Boards">boards section</a>.
