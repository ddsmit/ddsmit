<h1>My Open Source Landfill for My Mind</h1>
<p>
  I have a goal to document more of <a href="/Thoughts/TIL">what I learn</a> as well
  as any information I agregate throughout the day. By sharing as much as I can, I hope
  that I can help someone. Worst case, I have a nice, generally available notepad.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also planning to write about anything else I think is interesting/worth documenting. So often, I think tech people get stuck on
  tech, but I am a human with lots of different interests.
