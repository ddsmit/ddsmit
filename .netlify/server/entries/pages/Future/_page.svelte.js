<h3>Get Low and Rusty 🦀</h3>
<p>The next language I am planning to learn is Rust. Although the learning curve to Rust is steep, I think it will help me learn
    better practices with memory management. Rust also seems to interopp with Python really well.
</p>
<h3>Write More ✍🏼</h3>
<p>There is so much data flowing through my head, and I&#39;ve already found myself coming back to some of the same problems I&#39;ve 
    solved before. I want to get in a better habbit of writing everything down either <a href="../Thoughts">on this site</a> or
    using the internal blog platform at work. Hopefully these articles will help somebody, like future me.
</p>
<h3>Great at the Basics of the Web 🕸️</h3>
<p>I believe the best way for me to become a good front-end developer is to learn html and css really well. Developers who are 
    confident with these technologies can create amazing results without any javascript.
</p>

<h3>Learn the Scripts ℘</h3>
<p>I&#39;m hoping to get as comfortable with vanilla javascript as I am with Python. I&#39;d also like to start learning TypeScript, Svelte,
    and React to augment my javascript skills.
</p>

<h3>Getting Func(tional Language)y 🕺🏼</h3>
<p>I woulds like to learn a functional language to learn a new paradigm. 
    I&#39;m still investigating which option I&#39;d like to try first for a functional langauge. 
    I&#39;m currently considering F#, Scala, and Cloujure.
