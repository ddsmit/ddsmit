<h2>So Much Datas, So Much Confusion</h2>
<p>
    There are many, many, many roles with "Data" in the title. There are Data Wranglers, Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers,
    etc. What do all of the different titles mean and what does their day to day work look like? Unfortunately, the answer is 
    (as many answers are), "it depends".
</p>
<h2>What is Data and Why Should We Care</h2>
<p>
    Throughout history, we have been collecting and acting on data. Whether it's a restaurante counting various orders to understand
    how they want to prep for the next day, or a company like Facebook analyzing extrememly grainular data points like dwell time, 
    mouse positions, clicks, etc (and processing them in a massive and highly advanced model), people have been using data to try
    and make better decisions.

    Over the last 3 years, I've struggled to control my RSI in my right wrist (repetetive strain injury, sometimes called carpel tunnel when it's in this area). 
    Though this time, I have been able to identify activities that create the most problems, and I have experimented with several things to improve the problem.
    I'm hoping by sharing my experience, that someone else may be able to find relief.
</p>
<h2>What Seems To Cause the Issue</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Lots of Mouse Use</h3>
        <p>
            If I'm doing work that requires a lot of precise mouse movements and clicks (ie low code platforms like 
            Azure Data Factory), it will flare up the issue. If I push through the numbness, it will become a burning pain. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Driving My Minivan</h3>
        <p>
            Luckily this is not true for normal, daily driving, but longer trips like 8 hours jogs to Orlando will flare up pain
            in my wrist. I haven't quite figured out if it's the angle that I hold the wheel, or that the lane keep assist provide more
            resistance than an older, dumb vehicle (like our '05 4runner), but I am lucky to have a wonder wife who is willing to massage it
            when it gets bad.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Preventative Measures I've Taken</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Better Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
            Although the primarily contributor to the pain is the mouse, using a keyboard with a shallow action before it bottoms 
            out will make the pain show up much faster (I still notice this if I'm using the laptop). At home, I switched to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Tenkeyless/dp/B08B5WFP9S/ref=asc_df_B08B5WFP9S/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=459723394535&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13827728575988499289&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1021222&hvtargid=pla-980834291680&psc=1&mcid=f92b67a2d74e35d5b6952e410afc1ed3&gclid=CjwKCAiA1MCrBhAoEiwAC2d64ZVhhxKoUCqncGMkL5TDGchWL4LAFKG5G3DJjPTi3eS81rz7uJC8VxoC7_oQAvD_BwE">
            Keychron K8 </a> with brown switches (not super duper loud so I don't annoy my wife). At work, I had them get some cheap 88 key keyboard with 
            blue switches (same layout as the keycrhon). I'm a big fan of the feel of a mechanical keyboard, and the toddler is a big 
            fan of the Keychron's backlighting. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Better Pointer Devices</h3>
        <p>
            I've testing a couple different things to reduce the pain from using a pointing device like a mouse. The first thing I 
            tried in my home setup was to use an right handed ergonomic mouse (very simular to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iClever-Ergonomic-Mouse-Adjustable-Comfortable/dp/B07YHS3W1Y/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2R82N0YXFDXCS&keywords=jelly+comb+rh+ergo+mouse&qid=1701931160&s=electronics&sprefix=jellycomb+rh+ergo+mouse%2Celectronics%2C86&sr=1-3">this one</a>).
            This mouse definately worked better than a traditional mouse, but the weight created some other problems with fast precision and fatigue. 
            The design also makes it impossible to switch between hands as another approach to control the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently at work, I ordered a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kensington-Orbit-Trackball-Scroll-K72337US/dp/B002OOWB3O/ref=sr_1_12_sspa?crid=13FITWP8ESU1G&keywords=track%2Bball&qid=1701931324&s=electronics&sprefix=track%2Bball%2Celectronics%2C90&sr=1-12-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9tdGY&th=1">
            symetrical track ball</a>. It took a bit to get used to it and dial in the sensitiviy, but I like it overall. I can potentially set 
            it up to use with my left hand, which is another approach I can take to reduce the pain. I do find myself putting my hand in an awkward position
            to click with my index finger which I think could be reduced/eliminated with a tilted design, but that would eliminate the ability to 
            switch hands. I also found the buttons to be a bit still to click. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the best device would be a dome shape capacitive (touch) surface to control the pointer position (a cross between
            a touch bad and a ball nouse) with variable tensions/force required for the button clicks.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Use Wrist Brace</h3>
        <p>
            I bought a reasonably priced wrist brace from everyone's favorite Arkansas based retail store. The brace helps stabilize
            the wrist and help prevent bad habbits and wrist angles. 
        </p>
    </li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Things You Can Do To Reduce the Pain Once It Shows Up</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Aleve</h3>
        <p>
            My doctor told me to use Aleve both as pain relief as well as an anti-inflamitory. She said that inflamation in the wrist
            can cause long-term damage, so it's better to take an anti-inflamitory even if the pain is barable. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Megaman Hand Squeeze Squeeze</h3>
        <p>
            My wonderful wife bought me the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hand-Massager-for-Arthritis-and-Carpal-Tunnel/dp/B08CDFLX47/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=hand+massage+for+arthritis&qid=1701932241&sr=8-5&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.17d9e15d-4e43-4581-b373-0e5c1a776d5d">
            hand massager</a> after I heard it recommended on <a href="https://www.codingblocks.net/">Coding Blocks</a>. It used a combination
            of heat, vibration, and it's worked quite well for me.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>STOP!!</h3>
        <p>
            If I'm in the middle of some heavy click action, switching to a less clicky task or going outside to play with 
            the dog is a huge help to keep the pain in check. I've also found that taking breaks helps clear my head, which 
            makes me more effective overall.

const __vite_glob_0_4 = `<h1>TIL: What is a parking lot?</h1>
<p>A place to park cars, trucks, and SUV's.</p>
<p>
    Just kidding. We're in the middle of multple transitions at work, some in team structure (createing cross-functional teams focused on domains and products) as well 
    as moving from a kanban approach to scrum. One question our scrum master asked at the end of our standup was "does anyone
    have anything for the parking lot?"
</p>
<p>
    It's very possible I missed an earlier meeting where this was explained, but I created a definition in my head of 
    "does anyone have any topics to share with the team?". Both our Scrum Master and Product Manager were out today, so I took
    over the standup meeting. After our normal round-robin discussion, I asked the question "Does anyone have anything for the
    parking lot? Also, can anyone tell me what the parking lot is?". It became pretty clear that no one that was on the call
    knew what it was either, which made me feel a little better.
</p>
<p>
    We decided to consult the robot (aka the Scheaffler bot, which is a GPT 3.5 based chat bot) to see what it had to say:
</p>
<i>What is a parking lot in the context of Agile?</i>
<blockquote>
    In the context of Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, the term "Parking Lot" refers to a space where team members can temporarily store ideas, concerns, or topics that arise during discussions but are not immediately relevant to the ongoing meeting or sprint. The Parking Lot serves as a holding area for items that need further discussion or attention but are not the primary focus of the current conversation or sprint planning.

Here's how the Parking Lot typically works in Agile meetings:<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>During Meetings:</strong><br>
        In various Agile ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, or Retrospective meetings, team members may come up with ideas or issues that are not directly related to the current agenda.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Temporary Storage:</strong>
        Instead of derailing the current discussion, these ideas or concerns are noted on a physical or virtual board designated as the Parking Lot.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Deferred Discussion:</strong>
        The items in the Parking Lot are set aside for later discussion. The team agrees to revisit them at an appropriate time, often toward the end of the meeting or during a dedicated time in the agenda.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Prioritization:</strong>
        At the designated time, the team reviews the items in the Parking Lot and decides whether to address them immediately or prioritize them for future discussions or actions.
    </li>
</ol>
The Parking Lot helps maintain focus during meetings, ensuring that the team can address critical topics without getting sidetracked by issues that are not immediately relevant. It also provides a mechanism for capturing important ideas and concerns that might otherwise be forgotten.

The use of a Parking Lot aligns with Agile principles of flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability, allowing teams to manage their time effectively while still addressing important matters.
</blockquote>
<p>
    While my understanding wasn't conpletely wrong, it was good to learn about the intent of the "parking lot" as a means to keep 
    focus on the stories/tasks that are critical to achieve your objectives.

const __vite_glob_0_5 = "<h1>TIL: The pains of the Python Azure Data Factory SDK</h1>\n<h2>Why was I digging into this abyss</h2>\n<p>\n    Our team uses a couple common data factories to handle some of the most common data tasks. We recently ran into a limit that \n    would prevent us from migrating from the development environment to the productive environment. We decided to use a different \n    approach to parameters to bring down this limit, but we wanted to have the pipeline fully tested, which could be very time \n    consuming. \n</p>\n<p>\n    I had been wanting to look into the Python Azure Data Factory SDK for a while (I dream of creating a TUI interface that lets \n    me keyboard navigate my way through the pipelines), and automating the tests seemed like a good reason to dive in. \n</p>\n<h2>So Why The Pain?</h2>\n<p>\n    The biggest pain I ran into was how highly nested the data structures are. From an API vs SDK consistency standpoint, it makes\n    sense, but it felt really combersome to figure out. Also, I still have not found out how to get all of the information I need.\n</p>";
const __vite_glob_0_6 = "<h2>What do I wish?</h2>\n<p>\n    This area of my thoughts is a way to jot down some things I think of that would\n    be great to have in some of the languages and tools I use most often, as soon as I think of them.\n    Eventually, I will submit peps, requests, etc to address the concerns.\n</p>";
const __vite_glob_0_7 = "<h3>Allow Dynamic Selection of a Linked Service from a Dataset</h3>\n<p>\n    We have a datafactory that is set up to handle some of our most common use cases. For all of the staging/quality check logic that\n    interacts with a SQL database (ASQL, SQL Server with SQL Auth, SQL Server with Windows Auth), we end up duplicating logic 3 times. It \n    would be much cleaner and easier to maintain if a linked service could be dynamically selected by a dataset based on parameters passed \n    to the dataset.  \n</p>\n<h3>Allow Passing Pipelines Into Other Pipelines as Paramters</h3>\n<p>\n    To reduce complexity, it would be nice to pass in the pipeline that contains specific logic (IE a different source) into a \n    standard pipeline that performs other common tasks (ie metadata, status tables, quality checks). \n</p>\n<h3>Allow Enum Types for Parameters</h3>\n<p>\n    We have several situations where we have a limited list of options we use to drive behavior. One example is if we want to \n    drop, truncate, or do nothing to the staging and final tables. We end up using a match statement against a string the user \n    enters, but this is a lot more error prone than an Enum with a drop-down would be. \n</p>\n<h3>Better Keyboard Support</h3>\n<p>\n    For being a tool that developers will likely use, Azure Data Factory's interface doesn't seem to accomidate keyboard control \n    at all. There are small things like using Alt+Shift+D to bring up the dynamic menu, but once you do the focus isn't even put in the \n    field to add your expression. If you're entering parameters, tabbing moves between the page structure instead of between fields, and \n    there is no way to use the keyboard to edit the field without clicking. It would also be nice there were shortcuts to move between Factory Resoures\n    (with arrows to cycle through the structure), activities, and the editing panel(s). It would also be good to be able to tab through\n    any open pipelines (simular to Shift+tab on Edge). \n</p>\n<h3>Make It Open Source</h3>\n<p>\n    I would personally address many of the issues if the tools was open source. Given that Microsoft as a whole is moving towards fabric,\n    I don't think there is a big risk of allowing a competitive advantage to another company by doing this. \n</p>";

If you could use the users log in to authenticate to the endpoint using SSO, \n    it would allow us to dynamically provide the authorization data on request instead of precalculatin the table and loading the data.\n    Another option could be allowing for session based refresh on a direct query data source with pass through credentials (using direct query \n    tends to send way more queries that would be needed for this use case).\n</p>\n';

<h3>Add Conditional Syntax to a Normal For Loop</h3>
<p>
    Quite often, I am using a for loop with an if statement to output or process an item from an iterable based on a certain condition. 
    I really like the syntax from list comprehensions:
    <Snippet code='
    [
        thing
        for thing in things
        if thing == "what I want"
    ]
    '/>
    It would be great if you can simplify the use case where a loop is cleaner/required to be able to use the conditional right in the for statement:
    
    <Snippet code='
for thing in things if thing == "what I want":
    process_thing(thing)
'/>

I used to develop this site.
</p>
<h2> The Svelte/SvelteKit Website and Documentation</h2>
<p>
The Svelte website is a fantastic resource. The ability to try out examples in the in browser editor helped keep me engaged and
ultimately made it easier for me to learn.

<h2>Pico CSS</h2>
<p>
Pico CSS is a fantastic library that makes your website look much better with nothing more than semantic HTML. I really like
how it's lightweight and doesn't require a bunch of tags, which makes the code cleaner.

<h2>Kevin Powell's YouTube</h2>
<p>
Kevin Powell has some fantatic videos primarily centered around CSS. The triangle pattern on the header/footer were inspired 
by one of his videos. I've watched many others, but those will be things I may add in the future.

    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell">Kevin's YouTube Channel</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWGgw1K-i8Y">Creative Border Shape</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Animation.css</h2>
<p>
I used the css file Neale outlines in a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-handy-little-system-for-animated-entrances-in-css/">CSS Tricks article</a> for many of the open animations (the nav bar, the roles in History). I've also been referencing this file in my own attempts at animation.

<h2>PrismJS</h2>
<p>
    For code snippets, I created a small component based on PrismJS. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the Python support working in this context. For the small snippets I've done so far, the JavaScript formatting has been fine, but it is likely something I'll need to resolve in the future.
