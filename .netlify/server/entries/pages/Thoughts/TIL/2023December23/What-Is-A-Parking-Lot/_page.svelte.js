<p>A place to park cars, trucks, and SUV&#39;s.</p>
<p>Just kidding. We&#39;re in the middle of multple transitions at work, some in team structure (createing cross-functional teams focused on domains and products) as well 
    as moving from a kanban approach to scrum. One question our scrum master asked at the end of our standup was &quot;does anyone
    have anything for the parking lot?&quot;
</p>
<p>It&#39;s very possible I missed an earlier meeting where this was explained, but I created a definition in my head of 
    &quot;does anyone have any topics to share with the team?&quot;. Both our Scrum Master and Product Manager were out today, so I took
    over the standup meeting. After our normal round-robin discussion, I asked the question &quot;Does anyone have anything for the
    parking lot? Also, can anyone tell me what the parking lot is?&quot;. It became pretty clear that no one that was on the call
    knew what it was either, which made me feel a little better.

<p>We decided to consult the robot (aka the Scheaffler bot, which is a GPT 3.5 based chat bot) to see what it had to say:

<i>What is a parking lot in the context of Agile?</i>
<blockquote>In the context of Agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, the term &quot;Parking Lot&quot; refers to a space where team members can temporarily store ideas, concerns, or topics that arise during discussions but are not immediately relevant to the ongoing meeting or sprint. The Parking Lot serves as a holding area for items that need further discussion or attention but are not the primary focus of the current conversation or sprint planning.

Here&#39;s how the Parking Lot typically works in Agile meetings:<br><br>
<ol><li><strong>During Meetings:</strong><br>
        In various Agile ceremonies, such as Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, or Retrospective meetings, team members may come up with ideas or issues that are not directly related to the current agenda.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong>
        Instead of derailing the current discussion, these ideas or concerns are noted on a physical or virtual board designated as the Parking Lot.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Deferred Discussion:</strong>
        The items in the Parking Lot are set aside for later discussion. The team agrees to revisit them at an appropriate time, often toward the end of the meeting or during a dedicated time in the agenda.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong>
        At the designated time, the team reviews the items in the Parking Lot and decides whether to address them immediately or prioritize them for future discussions or actions.
    </li></ol>
The Parking Lot helps maintain focus during meetings, ensuring that the team can address critical topics without getting sidetracked by issues that are not immediately relevant. It also provides a mechanism for capturing important ideas and concerns that might otherwise be forgotten.

The use of a Parking Lot aligns with Agile principles of flexibility, collaboration, and adaptability, allowing teams to manage their time effectively while still addressing important matters.

<p>While my understanding wasn&#39;t conpletely wrong, it was good to learn about the intent of the &quot;parking lot&quot; as a means to keep 
    focus on the stories/tasks that are critical to achieve your objectives.
